There is always room for improvement.

So far I've done:

1) BinaryGap (Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer)
2) CyclicRotation (Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps)
3) OddOccurrencesInArray (Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.)
4) FrogJmp (Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y)
5) PermMissingElem (Find the missing element in a given permutation.)
6) TapeEquilibrium - (Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|.)
7) FrogRiverOne (Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river.)
8) MaxCounters (Calculate the values of counters after applying all alternating operations: increase counter by 1; set value of all counters to current maximum)
9) MissingInteger (Find the smallest positive integer that does not occur in a given sequence.)
10) PermCheck (Check whether array A is a permutation)
11)CountDiv (Compute number of integers divisible by k in range [a..b].)
12) GenomicRangeQuery (Find the minimal nucleotide from a range of sequence DNA.)
13) MinAvgTwoSlice - (Find the minimal average of any slice containing at least two elements.)
14) PassingCars - (Count the number of passing cars on the road.)
15) Distinct (Compute number of distinct values in an array.)
16) MaxProductOfThree (Maximize A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] for any triplet (P, Q, R).)
